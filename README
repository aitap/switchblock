How to use:
1) install memlockd and add memlockd_switchblock.conf to its configuration
2) write an /etc/switchblocktab consisting of lines "<name> <uuid>"
3) install udev rule to /lib/udev/rules.d/61-switchblock-activation.rules
3) put initramfs-tools hook to /etc/initramfs-tools/hooks/local-top/
4) fix your fstab to point to /dev/mapper/<name> instead of UUID=<uuid>
5) update-initramfs and update-grub
6) reboot

Next time the USB thumbdrive/harddrive loses power and decides to reinitialize itself you won't have to reboot and wait for fsck to clean up the mess.

The feature is inspired by a similar one in WinToGo.
