How to use:
1) install memlockd and add memlockd_switchblock.conf to its configuration
2) write an /etc/switchblocktab consisting of lines "<name> <uuid>"
3) install udev rule to /lib/udev/rules.d/61-switchblock-activation.rules and the switchblock script to /lib/udev/
3) put initramfs-tools hook to /etc/initramfs-tools/hooks/local-top/
4) fix your fstab to point to /dev/mapper/<name> instead of UUID=<uuid>
5) update-initramfs and update-grub
6) reboot

Next time the USB thumbdrive/harddrive loses power and decides to reinitialize itself you won't have to reboot and wait for fsck to clean up the mess.

The feature is inspired by a similar one in WinToGo.

If you're building a liveusb,
1) from your initramfs, once you locate the thumbdrive, unmount it and remember its UUID
2) run switchblock script to create the logical device, mount it and setup tmpfs overlay as usual
3) before switching root fs, generate /etc/switchblocktab inside it
